/// @file
///
/// This file defines the interface for a write-ahead log (WAL). The required
/// pattern of usage is:
/// - Open a WAL (either new or existing) with wal_open(). If opening an
///   existing WAL, wal_open() will fail if the WAL is corrupt.
/// - Append page-sized entries to the WAL using wal_append().
/// - Flush all changes to the WAL to disk using wal_sync().
/// - Apply the changes in the WAL to another file using wal_apply().
/// - Destroy the WAL using wal_destroy(), which removes it from the file
///   system.
